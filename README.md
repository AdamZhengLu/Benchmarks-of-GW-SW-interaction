Getting  started
--------------------
Two overland flow-only benchmarking cases are involved and two integrated benchmarking cases are presented.

Workflow Scripts
--------------------
Eight examples show the older with increasing complexity
1. `surface_1D parking lot`: overland flow hydrograph associated with uniform rainfall in a simple 1D test case
2. `surface_2D v-catchment`: overland flow generated by a rainfall event is then simulated on a simple tilted V-catchment
3. `surface-subsurface_2D v-catchment infiltration excess`: Coupled groundwater-surface water flow in a 2D infiltration excess test case (Hortonian flow)
4. `surface-subsurface_2D v-catchment saturation excess`: Coupled groundwater-surface water flow in a 2D saturation excess test case (Dunne flow)
5. `surface-subsurface_2D v-catchment slab`: Irregular Coupled groundwater-surface water flow in a 2D heterogeneous slab test case
6. `surface-subsurface_2D v-catchment return flow`: Coupled groundwater-surface water flow in a 2D return flow test case
7. `surface-subsurface_2D sandbox`: Coupled groundwater-surface water flow first performed by simulating a laboratory experiment conducted by Abdul and Gillham
8. `3d-hillslope`
